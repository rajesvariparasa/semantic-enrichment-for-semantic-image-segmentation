# Knowledge-based semantic enrichments for semantic image segmentation
This codebase is actively being developed as part of my master's thesis on Knowledge-based semantic enrichment for semantic image segmentation for the task of land cover classification. More to come soon!

The ssl implementation needs a reconstruction head implemented in this version of SMP library: 
[SMP ReconstructionHead](https://github.com/rajesvariparasa/segmentation_models.pytorch_reconstructionhead)

Install using command:
`pip install -e git+git://github.com/wdonahoe/rajesvariparasa/segmentation_models.pytorch_reconstructionhead.git`


Notebook for visual comparison of complete supervised segmentation results:
